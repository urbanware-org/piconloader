# How-to

## Current documentation

The documentation is available in the following languages:

*   `piconloader_de.md` :de: German
*   `piconloader_en.md` :us: English

# Archived documentation

The original how-to files in plain text files can be found inside the `archive` sub-directory. Initially the documentation was written in German language, as the *PiconLoader* project was first uploaded into a German forum for the satellite receiver. Later, those instructions have been translated to English, but not one-to-one.
