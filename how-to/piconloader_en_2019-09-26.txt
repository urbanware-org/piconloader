1. Preface

    I wrote this script for a good friend of mine who asked me, if it was
    possible to automatically change the picons of the channels at a certain
    time.

    It was developed on a Vu+ Duo2 satellite receiver, but may also work on
    other devices. However, I never tested that. The code behind the script is
    not that beautiful, but works. Of course, it still can be improved and
    also enhanced.

    The script was distributed under the MIT License, which can be found
    inside the 'LICENSE.md' file or on the following website:

        https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

    Installing and configuring the script, requires fundamental experience
    with Linux, its shell and 'vi' (not Vim, as it is not available on the
    system) for editing files.

    Notice that improper use of the command-line (e.g. modifying files inside
    system directories) will corrupt your system! Due to this, you have to be
    careful and understand what you're doing ("think before you type").

    The corresponding picon names for the channels can be determined with the
    dreamboxEDIT tool.

    Please do not ask me anything about the receiver (as I don't have one
    myself) or the dreamboxEDIT software.

2. Installation

    2.1 Copying the archive file to the receiver

        First of all, the TAR archive containing the PiconLoader must be
        copied to the receiver.

        The following instructions use the archive of version 1.0.3. The
        version number is part of the archive file name. When installing a
        newer version, the file name in the commands must be adjusted.

        2.1.1 Windows systems

            The archive file can be transferred to the receiver using the free
            PSCP tool which can be downloaded here:

                https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

            Let's assume the archive 'piconloader-1.0.3.tar' is located inside
            'C:\vu' on the local hard disk and the receiver has the IP address
            192.168.1.1. The corresponding command would look like as follows.
            It must be written in a single line without the underscore.

                pscp.exe -scp C:\vu\piconloader-1.0.3.tar _
                              root@192.168.1.1:/media/hdd/

        2.1.2 Unix-like systems (Linux, BSD, MacOSX)

            Usually, these operating systems already include the 'scp' tool
            for transferring files.

            Let's assume the archive 'piconloader-1.0.3.tar' is located inside
            '/home/user/' on the local hard disk and the receiver has the IP
            address 192.168.1.1. The corresponding command would look like as
            follows. It can also be written in a single without the backslash.

                scp /home/user/piconloader-1.0.3.tar \
                    root@192.168.1.1:/media/hdd/

    2.2 Connect to the device via SSH

        After the archive has been copied to the hard disk of the receiver,
        the next step is to establish an SSH connection to the device.

        2.2.1 Windows systems

            You may use the free tool called PuTTY, which can also be
            downloaded here:

                https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

        2.2.2 Unix-like systems (Linux, BSD, MacOSX)

            Usually, these operating systems already include the 'ssh' tool
            for establishing SSH connections.

                ssh root@192.168.1.1

    2.3 Extracting the archive on the receiver

        After transferring the file, the archive must be extracted on the hard
        disk of the receiver. Switch to the corresponding directory:

            cd /media/hdd

        Inside this directory you can find the transferred archive and extract
        it as follows.

            tar xvf piconloader-1.0.3.tar

        After that, the directory '/media/hdd/piconloader' will be created
        which contains the actual as well as some empty sub-directories so
        far.

        The archive file can now be deleted again:

            rm piconloader-1.0.3.tar

    2.4 Setting the executable flag

        In order to use the script, it must be executable. This should already
        be the case, but if it is not (for whatever reason) you can set the
        executable flag manually as mentioned below.

        If the script already is executable and you run following command
        anyway, it will have no effect.

            chmod +x ./piconloader/piconloader.sh

    2.5 Adding the required cronjob

        The PiconLoader script is being triggered every minute using a cronjob
        (using init scripts did not work before), but this does not affect the
        performance of the device, neither when watching TV nor when doing HD
        recordings.

        Edit the crontab file '/etc/cron/crontab/root' and the following line:

            * */1 * * * sh /media/hdd/piconloader/piconloader.sh

        Save and close the file. After that, reload the crontab as follows:

            crontab /etc/cron/crontabs/root

3. Usage examples

    Notice that PiconLoader uses the 24-hour time format. So, for example,
    8 PM is equal to 20:00 h.

    Let's assume the channel FooTV is on from 6:30 AM to 8:00 PM and outside
    this time, BarTV is. In this case the quarter-hourly way (which is also
    being used for changing picons half-hourly, three-quarter-hourly and full-
    hourly) is required.

    Get the PNG picon file of FooTV. Which name the corresponding picon must
    have can be seen using dreamboxEDIT. For example:

        1_0_1_9999_436_1_C0000X_0_0_0.png

    Then, get the picon file for BarTV and rename it as the picon of FooTV
    with a leading underscore:

        _1_0_1_9999_436_1_C0000X_0_0_0.png

    Now there is the following situation:

        1_0_1_9999_436_1_C0000X_0_0_0.png  (picon of FooTV)
        _1_0_1_9999_436_1_C0000X_0_0_0.png (picon of BarTV)

    Copy both picons into '/media/hdd/' on the receiver (using 'scp' or
    'pscp').

    Back in the SSH session, switch to the 'piconloader' directory

        cd /media/hdd/piconloader/

    and create the two directories for both times inside the 'qhourly' sub-
    directory as follows. Notice that you have to use dashes instead of
    colons, as colons are not supported in file or directory names on FAT32
    and NTFS file systems.

        mkdir ./qhourly/06-30
        mkdir ./qhourly/20-00

    Move the picon from FooTV into the first directory:

        mv /media/hdd/1_0_1_9999_436_1_C0000X_0_0_0.png ./qhourly/06-30

    Then move the picon from FooTV into the second directory and rename the
    file so it has the same name as the file from FooTV (can be done with a
    single command):

        mv /media/hdd/_1_0_1_9999_436_1_C0000X_0_0_0.png \
           ./qhourly/20-00/1_0_1_9999_436_1_C0000X_0_0_0.png

    At your television, switch to the channel where FooTV and BarTV are on.
    If you already are watching that channel, switch to another one and back
    again.

    After one minute the corresponding picon should be loaded, depending on
    the time. To be precise, the PNG picon file will be copied into the
    '/usr/share/enigma2/picon' directory where all picons are stored and
    overwrite the current one.

    The daily and monthly way actually works the same, with the difference
    that there are different directories you need to copy the files to.

    For example, to change a picon on January, 3rd, the PNG picon file must
    be copied into the 'daily' sub-directory (must also be created, of
    course):

        ./daily/01-03

    To monthly change a picon, in January the corresponding directory would be
    the following:

        ./monthly/01
