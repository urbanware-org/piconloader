    3. Usage examples

1. Installation

    First of all, copy the TAR archive (e. g. 'piconloader-1.0.3.tar') onto
    the receiver. On Unix-like systems you can do that with 'scp', on Windows
    you can use the free 'pscp' tool:

        https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

    To avoid that the script and its configuration are getting deleted after a
    firmware update, it should be copied into the directory of the internal
    hard disk ('/media/hdd/').

    Next, connect to the device using SSH and login as root. On Unix-like
    systems you usually do that with 'ssh', on Windows you can use PuTTY which
    is also available for free at the website mentioned above.

    Switch to the directory of the internal hard disk ('/media/hdd/'), create
    a directory called 'piconloader' extract move the TAR archive there:

        tar xfv piconloader-1.0.3.tar

    This will create a new sub-directory called 'piconloader' containing the
    script as well as further sub-directories. After that, the archive can be
    deleted again.

        rm piconloader-1.0.3.tar

    Set executable flag for the script (should actually have it set, but to
    get sure):

        chmod +x ./piconloader/piconloader.sh

2. Cronjob

    The PiconLoader script is being triggered every minute using a cronjob
    (using init scripts did not work before), but this does not affect the
    performance of the device, neither when watching TV nor when doing HD
    recordings.

    Edit the crontab file '/etc/cron/crontab/root' and the following line:

        * */1 * * * sh /media/hdd/piconloader/piconloader.sh

    Save and close the file. After that, reload the crontab as follows:

        crontab /etc/cron/crontabs/root

3. Usage examples

    Notice that PiconLoader uses the 24-hour time format. So, for example,
    8 PM is equal to 20:00 h.

    Let's assume the channel FooTV is on from 6:30 AM to 8:00 PM and outside
    this time, BarTV is. In this case the quarter-hourly way (which is also
    being used for changing picons half-hourly, three-quarter-hourly and full-
    hourly) is required.

    Get the PNG picon file of FooTV. Which name the corresponding picon must
    have can be seen using dreamboxEDIT. For example:

        1_0_1_9999_436_1_C0000X_0_0_0.png

    Then, get the picon file for BarTV and rename it as the picon of FooTV
    with a leading underscore:

        _1_0_1_9999_436_1_C0000X_0_0_0.png

    Now there is the following situation:

        1_0_1_9999_436_1_C0000X_0_0_0.png  (picon of FooTV)
        _1_0_1_9999_436_1_C0000X_0_0_0.png (picon of BarTV)

    Copy both picons into '/media/hdd/' on the receiver (using 'scp' or
    'pscp').

    Back in the SSH session, switch to the 'piconloader' directory

        cd /media/hdd/piconloader/

    and create the two directories for both times inside the 'qhourly' sub-
    directory as follows. Notice that you have to use hyphens instead of
    colons, as colons are not supported in file or directory names on FAT32
    and NTFS file systems.

        mkdir ./qhourly/06-30
        mkdir ./qhourly/20-00

    Move the picon from FooTV into the first directory:

        mv /media/hdd/1_0_1_9999_436_1_C0000X_0_0_0.png ./qhourly/06-30

    Then move the picon from FooTV into the second directory and rename the
    file so it has the same name as the file from FooTV (can be done with a
    single command):

        mv /media/hdd/_1_0_1_9999_436_1_C0000X_0_0_0.png \
           ./qhourly/20-00/1_0_1_9999_436_1_C0000X_0_0_0.png

    At your television, switch to the channel where FooTV and BarTV are on.
    If you already are watching that channel, switch to another one and back
    again.

    After one minute the corresponding picon should be loaded, depending on
    the time. To be precise, the PNG picon file will be copied into the
    '/usr/share/enigma2/picon' directory where all picons are stored and
    overwrite the current one.

    The daily and monthly way actually works the same, with the difference
    that there are different directories you need to copy the files to.

    For example, to change a picon on January, 3rd, the PNG picon file must
    be copied into the 'daily' sub-directory (must also be created, of
    course):

        ./daily/01-03

    To monthly change a picon, in January the corresponding directory would be
    the following:

        ./monthly/01
